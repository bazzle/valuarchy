## What if we could fix this political problem with one simple idea?

**Systems work as designed, not as intended. Democracy’s design has a significant Funding flaw – the people who can promise anything to gain popularity, can also extract any cost to pay for those promises, regardless of the culture or era the democratic process takes place in.**

This inevitably results in the expansion of spending and size of government. And fosters a system where people are unable to make informed decisions on who to elect, so promises are judged only on emotional appeals. This gives a major advantage to socialist policies, and explains why all parties seem to tout the same welfare state principles.

Other ideologies have attempted to compete with socialist virtue signalling through reason, however this has been ineffective and it is the wrong approach. 

What is needed is a new system that corrects this flaw.

**Valuarchy is the novel system which solves the centuries long problems inherent with democracy.**

Valuarchy does this by leveraging the power of money as both a communication medium and a language to produce an intuitive outcome – efficient governments that serve their people.  This introductory book covers the funding flaw in detail, the intuitive concepts about how people interact with money, and the key design elements of Valuarchy.

**Valuarchy:** The system of evaluating a potential leader’s worth, realized through the citizen’s sum exchange of money under contract paid directly to the government.

**We need to give the people the information they need to make their own personally informed decision** and provide a fair playing field for all ideas to compete without advantage to a single ideology.
