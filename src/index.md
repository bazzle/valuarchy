title: Valuarchy – A Monetary Value Leadership System
---

## What if we could fix this political problem with one simple idea?

**Systems work as designed, not as intended. Democracy’s design has a significant flaw – the people who can promise anything to gain popularity, can also extract any cost to pay for those promises. This Funding Flaw creates a conflict of interests that results in a socialist advantage and produces leadership with undesirable qualities.**

The Funding Flaw has resulted in the ever expanding spending and size of government, regardless of ideology or era in which it is tried. Pairing this Funding Flaw with democratic popularity contests means the people are unable to make informed decisions on who to elect, so promises are judged only on emotional appeals.

Other ideologies have attempted to compete socialists virtue signalling through reason, however this has been ineffective and it is the wrong approach. What is needed is a new system that corrects these flaws.

We need to give the people the information they need to make their own personally informed decision.

We need a system which does not give any one ideology an advantage, but rather provides a fair playing field to compete.

**Valuarchy is the novel system which solves the centuries long problems inherent with democracy.**

Valuarchy has a simple design with an intuitive outcome – efficient governments that serve their people by leveraging the power of money as a communication medium and language to choosing leadership. This book covers the funding flaw in detail, the intuitive concepts about how people interact with money, and the key design elements of Valuarchy.

**Valuarchy:** The system of evaluating a potential leader’s worth, realized through the citizen’s sum exchange of money under contract paid directly to the government.

**We need to give the people the information they need to make an informed decision.**

We need a system which does not give any one ideology an advantage, but rather provides a fair playing field to compete.
